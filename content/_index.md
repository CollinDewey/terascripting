# Collin Dewey - About Me

I am working on my Masters of Science in Computer Science as well as a Cybersecurity Certificate from the University of Louisville. During my time at college I have actively engaged in the university's ACM student chapter, leading the Student Linux User Group for three years, and leading the [Cyber Defense Team](https://engineering.louisville.edu/cybercenter/homepage/student-activities/) since 2023. In Cyber Defense, my peers and I have excelled in Capture the Flag style exercises, as well as Red Team/Blue Team competitions.
